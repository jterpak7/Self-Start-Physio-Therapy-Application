        <p>
            The initial therapy session is a 90-minute video conference. Prior to our video conference, I will
            ask you to complete an initial intake form, submit posture photos and perform a simple
            movement assessment. The initial intake form will ask you questions about your current
            condition. The posture photos are simply four photos of yourself from head to toe and the
            movement assessment is a simple series of movements done in standing and sitting.<br><br>
            
            During the consultation we will review your therapy goals, discuss your condition in greater
            detail, and perform some simple movements. I will help you understand your condition and
            provide a movement sequence that will help alleviate pain. After consultation, a movement
            sequence will be uploaded to your account, where you can view your sequence at any time.
            Ideally, you will perform your movement sequence once daily. The sequence will be
            approximately 20-30 minutes in duration.<br><br>
            
            Follow up sessions are approximately 45 minutes in length and could be scheduled weekly for
            the first 3 weeks. After that point, you may schedule every 2-3 weeks. Learning how to
            perform the movement sequence correctly is essential. The movements are easy and inherent
            to your bodiesâ€™ natural design. The sessions will help you understand why you are performing
            a particular sequence of movement.<br><br>
            
            The number of sessions that are required varies from individual to individual. On average, 3
            sessions as a minimum and up to 8 sessions. You are are in control of how frequent you wish
            to schedule your followup appointments.<br><br>
